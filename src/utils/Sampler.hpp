/**
 * @brief Abstract base class for MCMC sampler implementations
 *
 * This class provides the foundation for implementing different MCMC sampling
 * algorithms for Bayesian nonparametric models including Dirichlet Process
 * (DP), Normalized Generalized Gamma Process (NGGP), and their weighted
 * variants (DPW, NGGPW). It holds references to all necessary components and
 * provides a unified interface for different sampling strategies.
 *
 * @details The class supports various MCMC algorithms through derived
 * implementations:
 * - **Gibbs Samplers**: Standard collapsed Gibbs sampling (Neal's Algorithm 3)
 * - **Split-Merge Samplers**: Advanced algorithms for better mixing (SAMS
 * variants)
 * - **Hybrid Approaches**: Combinations of different sampling strategies
 *
 * Each sampler operates on the same core components but implements different
 * strategies for exploring the posterior distribution of cluster assignments.
 * The composition pattern allows flexible combinations of different data types,
 * likelihood models, process priors, and parameter configurations.
 *

 * @see Neal3, SplitMerge, SplitMerge_SAMS

   * @brief Pure virtual method to perform one MCMC sampling step
   *
   * This method must be implemented by derived classes to define their specific
   * sampling algorithm. Each call should update the current state of the Markov
   * chain by sampling from the appropriate conditional distributions.
   *
   * @details Different sampler implementations use different strategies:
   * - **Gibbs samplers** (e.g., Neal3): Sequential sampling of individual
   * assignments
   * - **Split-Merge samplers**: Joint updates of multiple assignments via
   * split/merge moves
   * - **Hybrid samplers**: Combinations of multiple update mechanisms
   *
   * The method should update cluster assignments in the Data object and may
   * also update auxiliary variables or hyperparameters as needed by the
   * specific algorithm.
   *
   * @note This is a pure virtual function that must be overridden by concrete
   * sampler implementations
