/**
 * @brief Locality Sensitive Sampling (LSS) Split-Merge sampler for Bayesian
 * nonparametric models
 *
 * This class implements the LSS Split-Merge algorithm, a variant of the
 * split-merge sampler that uses locality sensitive sampling to select anchor
 * points based on similarity information. LSS can be more efficient than
 * standard split-merge for large datasets by focusing computational effort on
 * similar observations.
 *
 * @details Key differences from standard Split-Merge:
 * - **Locality Sensitive Sampling**: Anchor points are selected based on
 * similarity/distance
 * - **Sequential Allocation**: Observations are allocated one by one in random
 * order
 * - **Efficient Computation**: Faster proposal generation leveraging data
 * structure
 * - **Maintained Ergodicity**: Preserves theoretical properties of split-merge
 *
 * The algorithm maintains the same three types of moves (split, merge, shuffle)
 * but uses locality sensitive sampling for anchor point selection and
 * sequential allocation for generating proposals within each move type.
