/**
 * @brief Locality Sensitive Sampling (LSS) with SDDS Split-Merge sampler
 *
 * This class implements the LSS Split-Merge algorithm with SDDS (Smart-split,
 * Dumb-merge, Dumb-split, Smart-merge), a variant of the split-merge sampler
 * that uses locality sensitive sampling to select anchor points based on
 * similarity/dissimilarity information. The SDDS strategy adaptively chooses
 * between smart (sequential allocation) and dumb (simple random) proposals to
 * balance computational cost with proposal quality:
 * - When dissimilar points are selected: Smart split + Dumb merge
 * - When similar points are selected: Dumb split + Smart merge
 * This improves mixing efficiency while maintaining computational tractability.
 *
 * @details Key differences from standard Split-Merge:
 * - **Locality Sensitive Sampling**: Anchor points are selected based on
 * similarity/dissimilarity derived from distances
 * - **SDDS Strategy**: Adaptive smart/dumb pairing based on point similarity
 *   * Dissimilar points → Smart split (sequential allocation) + Dumb merge
 * (direct)
 *   * Similar points → Dumb split (random) + Smart merge (sequential
 * allocation)
 * - **Sequential Allocation**: Used in "smart" moves for intelligent proposal
 * generation
 * - **Efficient Computation**: Balances computational cost with mixing quality
 * - **Maintained Ergodicity**: Preserves theoretical properties of split-merge
 *
 * The algorithm maintains the same three types of moves (split, merge, shuffle)
 * but uses locality sensitive sampling for anchor point selection and
 * adaptively applies sequential allocation based on the SDDS strategy.

     * the SDDS strategy (Smart-split, Dumb-merge, Dumb-split, Smart-merge):
     *
     * 1. Randomly choose between dissimilarity mode or similarity mode (50/50)
     * 2. Select two anchor observations using locality sensitive sampling:
     *    - Dissimilarity mode (move_type=0): select dissimilar points (weighted
     * by 1/distance)
     *    - Similarity mode (move_type=1): select similar points (weighted by
     * distance)
     * 3. Determine move type based on current cluster assignments:
     *    - Same cluster (ci == cj): propose split move
     *    - Different clusters (ci != cj): propose merge move
     * 4. Execute appropriate move using SDDS pairing:
     *    - Dissimilarity mode: **Smart split** if ci==cj, **Dumb merge** if
     * ci!=cj
     *    - Similarity mode: **Dumb split** if ci==cj, **Smart merge** if ci!=cj
     * 5. Optionally perform shuffle move to improve mixing
     * 6. Compute acceptance ratio and accept/reject the proposal
     *
     * The SDDS strategy balances computational efficiency with proposal quality
     * by using smart (sequential allocation) moves where they matter most and
     * dumb (simple random) moves elsewhere, while maintaining detailed balance.
