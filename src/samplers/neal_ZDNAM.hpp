 * @class Neal3ZDNAM
 * @brief Neal's Algorithm 3 with ZDNAM for improved collapsed Gibbs sampling
 *
 * @details This class implements Neal's Algorithm 3 (collapsed Gibbs sampler)
 * enhanced with the Zero-self Downward Nested Antithetic Modification (ZDNAM)
 * from Neal's Algorithm 5. The ZDNAM modification eliminates self-transitions
 * in the Gibbs sampler, which can significantly improve mixing and reduce
 * autocorrelation in the MCMC chain.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - **Collapsed sampling**: Cluster parameters are integrated out analytically
 * - **Zero self-transitions**: ZDNAM ensures observations always move (when
 * possible)
 * - **Improved mixing**: Better exploration of the state space compared to
 * standard Gibbs
 * - **Automatic cluster management**: Creates and destroys clusters as needed
 *
 * **ZDNAM Algorithm:**
 * The ZDNAM modification constructs transition probabilities P(new_state |
 * current_state) such that P(current_state | current_state) = 0 when possible,
 * while maintaining the correct stationary distribution. This is achieved
 * through a careful construction involving nested antithetic coupling.
 *
 * **When to use:**
 * - High autocorrelation in standard Gibbs sampling
 * - When mixing is slow due to frequent self-transitions
 * - Models where observations tend to stay in the same cluster
 *
 * @note The algorithm falls back to standard Gibbs sampling in edge cases where
 * zero self-transition is not achievable (e.g., when one state has probability
 * ≥ 0.5).
 *
 * @note

 * Process Mixture Models" \n

 * Transitions"

   * @brief Update cluster assignment for a single observation using ZDNAM

   *
   * @details This method implements Neal's Algorithm 3 with ZDNAM enhancement:
   * 1. Record the current cluster assignment
   * 2. Temporarily remove the observation from its cluster
   * 3. Compute log probabilities for all existing clusters plus a new cluster
   * 4. Use ZDNAM to sample new assignment (avoiding self-transition when
   * possible)
   * 5. Assign observation to the sampled cluster
   *
   * The log probabilities combine:
   * - Prior probabilities from the Process (DP/NGGP weights)
   * - Conditional likelihood (with cluster parameters integrated out)
   *
   * The ZDNAM sampler uses the current cluster index to construct transition
   * probabilities that avoid returning to the same cluster.

   * @return Vector of transition probabilities P(·|current_k) with
   * P(current_k|current_k) = 0
   *
   * @details Implements Algorithm 5 from Neal (2019). The algorithm constructs
   * transition probabilities that:
   * - Have the correct stationary distribution π
   * - Satisfy P(current_k | current_k) = 0 when possible
   * - Use nested antithetic coupling for improved mixing
   *
   * **Algorithm Steps:**
   * 1. Normalize input to get target probabilities π
   * 2. Order states by decreasing probability (σ permutation)
   * 3. Process states sequentially, allocating transition probability
   * 4. Apply special ZDNAM construction when current state is reached
   * 5. Ensure zero self-transition probability
   *
   * **Special Cases:**
   * - If π[most_probable] ≥ 0.5: Use simpler construction (downward nesting)
   * - If current state has π = 0: Fall back to standard Gibbs
   * - If m ≤ 2: Simplified construction
   *
   * **Mathematical Guarantee:**
   * The returned transition matrix satisfies:
   * - Σⱼ P(j|current_k) = 1 (proper distribution)
   * - Σⱼ P(j|i)π(i) = π(j) (detailed balance with π)
   * - P(current_k|current_k) = 0 (zero self-transition)
   *
   * @note The construction involves careful numerical balancing to avoid
   * negative probabilities while maintaining detailed balance.

   * @details Executes one full sweep of the ZDNAM-enhanced collapsed Gibbs
   * sampler:
   * 1. Create a vector of all observation indices [0, 1, ..., n-1]
   * 2. Randomly shuffle the order to avoid systematic bias
   * 3. For each observation (in shuffled order):
   *    - Update its cluster assignment using ZDNAM
   *    - Automatically create/destroy clusters as needed
   * 4. Return with updated cluster configuration
   *
   * **After each step:**
   * - All observations have been given a chance to move clusters
   * - Zero self-transitions have been enforced (where possible)
   * - The chain has advanced by one full iteration
   * - The stationary distribution remains correct
   *
   * **Expected Behavior:**
   * Compared to standard Neal's Algorithm 3, this version should show:
   * - Reduced autocorrelation in cluster assignments
   * - Faster mixing of the MCMC chain
   * - More frequent cluster reassignments
   *
   * @note The random shuffling ensures that the order of updates does not
   * introduce systematic bias into the sampler.
