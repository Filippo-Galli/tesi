/**
 * @brief Split-Merge sampler for Bayesian nonparametric mixture models
 *
 * This class implements the split-merge algorithm, an advanced MCMC method that
 * proposes joint updates to cluster assignments through split and merge moves.
 * This approach can achieve better mixing than sequential Gibbs sampling,
 * particularly for models with strong within-cluster correlations.
 *
 * @details The algorithm alternates between three types of moves:
 * - **Split moves**: Divide a cluster into two subclusters
 * - **Merge moves**: Combine two clusters into one
 * - **Shuffle moves**: Redistribute observations between two existing clusters
 *
 * Each move uses restricted Gibbs sampling to generate proposals, followed by
 * Metropolis-Hastings acceptance/rejection based on prior and likelihood
 * ratios. The algorithm maintains detailed balance and ergodicity.
