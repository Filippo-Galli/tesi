/**
 * @brief Sequential Allocation Merge-Split (SAMS) sampler for Bayesian
 * nonparametric models
 *
 * This class implements the SAMS algorithm, a variant of the split-merge
 * sampler that uses sequential allocation instead of restricted Gibbs sampling
 * for proposal generation. SAMS can be more efficient than standard split-merge
 * for certain model configurations and provides an alternative proposal
 * mechanism.
 *
 * @details Key differences from standard Split-Merge:
 * - **Sequential Allocation**: Observations are allocated one by one in random
 * order
 * - **Simplified Proposals**: No need for full restricted Gibbs chains
 * - **Efficient Computation**: Faster proposal generation for large clusters
 * - **Maintained Ergodicity**: Preserves theoretical properties of split-merge
 *
 * The algorithm maintains the same three types of moves (split, merge, shuffle)
 * but uses a different mechanism for generating proposals within each move
 * type.
